        <p id="artigo">is Lorem Ipsum?
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's <br>
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make a type specimen book. <br>
            has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
            unchanged. <br>
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
            more recently <br>
            with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
